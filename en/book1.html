                    The global bestseller by Stephen R. Covey has helped millions of people around the world adopt
                    principles that allowed them to improve both their personal and professional lives. A respected
                    leadership expert and consultant to many global companies, the author defines seven core principles
                    that form the foundation of a purposeful, balanced personality and serve as the key to achieving a
                    successful, harmonious life. Through real-life examples, Covey demonstrates how following his
                    seven habits has brought remarkable results in personal growth as well as in relationships with
                    others. Over time, this world-famous bestseller has become a classic and an essential part of the
                    education of truly effective people, inspiring them not only in business but also in their private
                    lives. To date, more than 50 million copies have been sold, the book has been translated into 40
                    languages, and it ranks among the 100 most influential books of the 20th century.

                <p>
                    I read it during a period when I was thinking a lot about self-development, discipline, and mindful
                    living.
                </p>
