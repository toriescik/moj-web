                    What does it take to achieve the impossible, to overcome all obstacles and even our own
                    expectations? Or to fulfill our biggest dreams and turn them into reality? The truth is, we are
                    capable of far more than we think.
                    Steven Kotler is one of the world’s best-selling authors in the field of peak performance. He is
                    the director of Flow Research, an organization dedicated to understanding peak performance, and he
                    applies these insights to coaching individuals and organizations on how to reach their highest
                    potential. In this book, Kotler reveals the secrets behind the extraordinary performances of top
                    athletes, artists, scientists, and leaders who have redefined what is possible. Drawing on more
                    than 20 years of neuroscience research, he shows how to push beyond limits and achieve goals that
                    once seemed unattainable.
                    Achieve the Impossible is an inspiring read about unlocking your full potential. If you aim for
                    the stars, don’t hesitate to dive in – no spacesuit required.
